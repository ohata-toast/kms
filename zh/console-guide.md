### Create a Key
In Secure Key Manager, keys are categorized into three types: Confidential Data, Symmetric Key, and Asymmetric Key. For Confidential Data, Secure Key Manager stores string data and provides query feature using APIs. For Symmetric key, data encryption/decryption using APIs is provided. For Asymmetric Key, data signing/verification using APIs is provided. Users can select a key type appropriate for purpose and create keys.

Click **Key Management**, and a page to manage keys shows up like below:

### Import a Key
Secure Key Manager supports a feature to import a symmetric key (AES-256).

![console-guide-10](http://static.toastoven.net/prod_kms/2023-03-28-en/console-guide-10.png)

You can upload a key by entering a key value in the **Key Data** area, and the format of key that can be uploaded is as follows.

```
0xXX, 0xXX, ..., 0xXX
```

Upload the key by entering 32 hexadecimal strings separated by comma (`,`) or space (` `) used as delimiters, as shown above.

### Register Authentication Information
Keys that are created in Secure Key Manager are available only for successfully authenticated clients. You may register authentication information for client authentication from the menu of **IPv4 Address Management**, **MAC Address Management**, and **Certificate Management**.

### Manage User Data
Secure Key Manager provides detailed information on user-created data (e.g. key or authentication information). Click **Detail Key Information** on the list of user data, and details are displayed like below:

![console-guide-20](http://static.toastoven.net/prod_kms/2023-03-28-en/console-guide-20.png)

#### Delete User Data

The initial status of user-created data is **In Service**. To delete unnecessary data, click **Request for Deletion** in the **Detail Key Information** window.

![console-guide-21](http://static.toastoven.net/prod_kms/2023-03-28-en/console-guide-21.png)

Once requested for deletion, the data status is changed to **Scheduled to be Deleted**. Data in **Scheduled to be Deleted** status becomes unavailable and it is completely deleted in 7 days.

![console-guide-22](http://static.toastoven.net/prod_kms/2023-03-28-en/console-guide-22.png)

You may click **Immediately Delete** for data in **Scheduled to be Deleted** status to delete the data without having to wait until the scheduled deletion time, or click **Cancel Deletion** to revert it to **In Service** status.

![console-guide-23](http://static.toastoven.net/prod_kms/2023-03-28-en/console-guide-23.png)

#### Rotate Symmetric/Asymmetric Keys

In Secure Key Manager, symmetric/asymmetric keys can be rotated. Like shown below, auto rotation cycle can be set from the details page of Symmetric/Asymmetric Key. If you set the rotation cycle to '0', auto rotation is not enabled.

![console-guide-24](http://static.toastoven.net/prod_kms/2023-03-28-en/console-guide-24.png)

If you set the rotation cycle to 30 or higher, the next rotation date is displayed, and key is automatically rotated at every rotation cycle.

![console-guide-25](http://static.toastoven.net/prod_kms/2023-03-28-en/console-guide-25.png)

On the Detail Key Information page for Symmetric/Asymmetric Key, click **Immediately Rotate** to immediately rotate the key.

![console-guide-26](http://static.toastoven.net/prod_kms/2023-03-28-en/console-guide-26.png)

When a key is rotated, a new version is added to the list of key versions, like below:

![console-guide-27](http://static.toastoven.net/prod_kms/2023-03-28-en/console-guide-27.png)

As an exception, keys generated through key import do not provide the key rotation feature, unlike symmetric keys generated by Secure Key Manager. When you query the key, the key rotation area does not exist as shown below:

![console-guide-28](http://static.toastoven.net/prod_kms/2023-03-28-en/console-guide-28.png)

### Approval Feature

#### Enable Approval Feature
Enable Approval Feature of Secure Key Manager in Approval Process Management Setting on Governance Setting under Organization Management.

![console-guide-30](http://static.toastoven.net/prod_kms/2023-03-28-en/console-guide-30.png)

#### Differences with Approval Feature enabled
When you obtain the approver or requester role after enabling the approval feature, the **Approval List** and **Key Store Management** tabs are added to Secure Key Manager. Only the approver and requester can access these tabs.

![console-guide-31](http://static.toastoven.net/prod_kms/2023-03-28-en/console-guide-31.png)

When you enable the approval feature, data can no longer be added, modified, or deleted in the key store. When requesting for change, move to the **Key Store Management** tab.

![console-guide-32](http://static.toastoven.net/prod_kms/2023-03-28-en/console-guide-32.png)

#### Make Approval Requests
On the **Key Store Management** tab, the approver and requester make a request for approval of changes for each key store. Addition, modification, and deletion are performed through a similar operation to the existing keystore. Changes to keys and authentication information are displayed in Status as follows.

![console-guide-33](http://static.toastoven.net/prod_kms/2023-03-28-en/console-guide-33.png)

![console-guide-34](http://static.toastoven.net/prod_kms/2023-03-28-en/console-guide-34.png)

Make a request for approval with the **Request Approval** button in the key store, and the requests made for a project can be found in the **Approval List** tab.

![console-guide-35](http://static.toastoven.net/prod_kms/2023-03-28-en/console-guide-35.png)

#### Apply Approval Requests
On the  **Approval List** tab, the approver confirms the requst for approval of changes and determines whether to apply the request by selecting **Approve** or **Deny**.
